    puts "    Connect Four is a classic board game where players take turns trying to
    create a line of four of their own pieces without being blocked by their
    opponent.

    The rules are simple:
    At the prompt each player, in turn, will choose a column in which to drop
    their chip.

    The game ends when one of the two players successfully lines up four of
    their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

    The first to player to line up for chips wins the round. The game ends
    in a draw if the 7-column, 6-row grid is filled without either player
    successfully connecting four.

    Player one = 'X', Player two = 'O'."
